# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), Fullstack, crossplatform,lightning fast, fully typed Rust library for web.
As for the back-end, it is built using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/), a web framework written in Go (Golang).

To run this project, you will need to have Rust and Go installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Go by following the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
